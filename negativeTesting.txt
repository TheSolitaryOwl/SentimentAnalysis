Carrot cake really sucks I mean honestly who even likes carrots
Literally no one could ever enjoy the carrot taste in carrot cake
If I had a dollar for every time I enjoyed the real carrot taste of carrot cake I'd have exactly 0 dollars
The other day I microwaved french fries two days after ordering them and that tasted better than this carrot cake
I wouldn't even donate this carrot cake to the food pantry in case it makes someone sick
Who even likes carrots
One man's carrot cake is another man's carrot trash
This carrot cake literally gave me cancer
how could someone make such a monstrosity of a cake
the cake was an abomination
where can i find the trashcan where this baked good belongs
that person thought this cake was not good
i think this cake is worse than the last one i ate
the lovely person brought in a poorly made cake
that cake caused a great deal of sadness after eating it
i thought id be happy to eat this cake but it ended up making me feel sick because it was not good
this cake is chocolate so therefore not good
i had a cake at a restaurant that was terrible
that cake was terrible
what a sad excuse for a cake
i have never had a cake that tasted that bad
i hated every bite of cake
that cake was dry and tasteless
the cake was awful and tasted like cardboard
i never want to eat a cake like that again
i disliked the cake
i would rather eat my own liver than one more bite of that cake
that cake was nasty and disgusting
