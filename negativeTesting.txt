I have eaten many bad cakes in my life but this one is by far the worst
When you eat such a bad cake as this it really puts your life in perspective
that person thought this cake was not good
That made me so sick Ive been in bed all daydoes anyone want to eat my cake i can pay them seriously i dont want to eat it but don't want it to go to waste
boooooooooo
This cake is disgusting I won't eat another piece
I strip this cake of its title of cake it is a shame to all other cake
They messed up my cake but refused to give a refund if you're reading this Bob you'll be hearing from my lawyerThis is the worst dessert I have had in my entire life
Cake will kill your dog if it is made of chocolate
It's a horrible cake
how is this bakery still in business
One man's carrot cake is another man's carrot trash
it's fruitcake enough said
there were carrots on my cake
Too much cake being a good thing is a lie too little is still too much
The cake was old
the cake was dry and nasty
My tongue will never be the same after allowing that travesty of a cake to come in contact with it
on a spongy texture
I thought this cake was bad
my mom said I wasn't allowed to write a review because of what I had to say
I would give this establishment negative stars if I could
The other day I microwaved french fries two days after ordering them and that tasted better than this carrot cake
i disliked the cake
the baker must have a low iq
This chocolate cake makes me want to vomit
It looked ok but the taste was bad
I knew I should not have gotten the dessert at this restaurant
