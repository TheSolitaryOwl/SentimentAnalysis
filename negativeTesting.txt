this is my last will and testament I leave everything do the dog because my dog didn't tell me to come here
Ordered a birthday cake and it came out completely wrong
I would give this establishment negative stars if I could
I strip this cake of its title of cake it is a shame to all other cake
The cake is terrible
that cake was nasty and disgusting
It's the worst day of my life and I am 80
This place used to be really good but its quality has declined over the years
The eclairs were bad and so was the service
whoever baked this cake does not know how to cook a good cake
The cake at this shop should never have been madeI swear these people have no idea what good cuisine is trust me I work at a four star restaurant
They messed up my cake but refused to give a refund if you're reading this Bob you'll be hearing from my lawyerThis is the worst dessert I have had in my entire life
I took the hit for you guys so take my advice and avoid this cake
I wish I was never born after eating this cake
that cake was dry and tasteless
This cake deserves to be in trashi was very displeased with this cake do not try it
another bite
Too much cake being a good thing is a lie too little is still too much
when i put this cake into my mouth i instantly gagged and spit it out
This cake is leaves a bad taste in my mouth
do not ever try this cake it will make you want to gagThe cake was absolutely awful
Literally no one could ever enjoy the carrot taste in carrot cake
Cake will kill your dog if it is made of chocolate
I wouldn't even donate this carrot cake to the food pantry in case it makes someone sick
The other day I microwaved french fries two days after ordering them and that tasted better than this carrot cake
I cannot stand cake even in the slightest
Cake will lure you in with a good presentation then torture you with choking
the cake is the most nasty thing in the world
