This cake is so bad that it made me never want to eat cake again
You know your cake is bad when you eat the cake and it tastes bad
When you eat such a bad cake as this it really puts your life in perspective
I like the inside pieces but they gave me an edge piece
What is this filth
the cake was an abomination
this is a great disappointment just like me according to my father
this bakery must have one star
His cake not only tasted bad but it also gave me food poisoning
i had a cake at a restaurant that was terrible
I cannot stand cake even in the slightest
this cake is just like mom used to make I always hated it
If I had a dollar for every time I enjoyed the real carrot taste of carrot cake I'd have exactly 0 dollars
Ordered a birthday cake and it came out completely wrong
that cake was nasty and disgusting
I would give this establishment negative stars if I could
That is the lousiest excuse for a cake that I have ever seen
The taste of their strawberry cake is unacceptable
If you have any happiness left in your life I would recommend avoiding this cake
my mom said I wasn't allowed to write a review because of what I had to say
whoever baked this cake does not know how to cook a good cake
that cake was terrible
Whenever I see a piece of cake it makes me want to cry
This cake is leaves a bad taste in my mouth
One man's carrot cake is another man's carrot trash
This cake is garbage
I hate this sweet mess more than my ex wife
Ive had way better cake than this chocolate cake
