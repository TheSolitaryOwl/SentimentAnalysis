my dad hits me with cake
His cake not only tasted bad but it also gave me food poisoning
The piece yesterday was not a good piece
that cake was nasty and disgusting
This cake is so bad that it made me never want to eat cake again
I would give this establishment negative stars if I could
I like the inside pieces but they gave me an edge piece
Each time I am forced to go here I die a little inside
I wish I had avoided this
It looked ok but the taste was bad
the baker must have a low iq
There was absolutely too much sugar in that cake and it made me what to puke
If you have any happiness left in your life I would recommend avoiding this cake
This cake deserves to be in trashi was very displeased with this cake do not try it
the cake was an abomination
on a spongy texture
What is this filth
Cake sucks
i just wanted to eat a delicious cake but was saddened by the pure disgust i felt on the first bite
this is a great disappointment just like me according to my father
when i put this cake into my mouth i instantly gagged and spit it out
i disliked the cake
That cake tastes bad
The eclairs were bad and so was the service
It's the worst day of my life and I am 80
that person thought this cake was not good
This place used to be really good but its quality has declined over the years
I've never had such a horrible cake before
