Each time I am forced to go here I die a little inside
I strip this cake of its title of cake it is a shame to all other cake
my grandmother didn't give her life in a world war for the quality of this cake
This carrot cake literally gave me cancer
If you have any happiness left in your life I would recommend avoiding this cake
on a spongy texture
i have never had a cake that tasted that bad
The taste of their strawberry cake is unacceptable
i never want to eat a cake like that again
I don't see what all of the hype is about
The ugliest cake I've ever seen
That cake tastes bad
The one time I decide to have dessert and this is what I get
It feels like cake hates me and honestly I hate it just as much
booo
where can i find the trashcan where this baked good belongs
The cake sucks don't eat it
Were there the option of going back in time to stop myself from eating the cake I would do it in a heartbeat
This chocolate cake makes me want to vomit
I ordered a graduation cake and it looked nothing like the picture on the website
I like the inside pieces but they gave me an edge piece
Their chocolate cake is awful and it tastes very cheap
i had a cake at a restaurant that was terrible
Cake will kill your dog if it is made of chocolate
it's fruitcake enough said
Am having such a bad day
I do not like this not one bit
What is this filth
