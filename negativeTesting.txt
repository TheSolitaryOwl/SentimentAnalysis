Am having such a bad day
What is this filth
that cake was dry and tasteless
i hated every bite of cake
another bite
this cake is chocolate so therefore not good
I have no idea why in the world anyone would ever want to eat a cake that tastes just like real carrots
Ive had way better cake than this chocolate cake
The cake shop in the mall has some atrocious cakes
Their banana nut bread tasted dry I needed three glasses of milk after I ate it
I knew I should not have gotten the dessert at this restaurant
when i put this cake into my mouth i instantly gagged and spit it out
If I had a dollar for every time I enjoyed the real carrot taste of carrot cake I'd have exactly 0 dollars
The taste of their strawberry cake is unacceptable
how could someone make such a monstrosity of a cake
The cake sucks don't eat it
The one time I decide to have dessert and this is what I get
the cake is the most nasty thing in the world
i thought id be happy to eat this cake but it ended up making me feel sick because it was not good
That is the lousiest excuse for a cake that I have ever seen
Cake sucks
this is my last will and testament I leave everything do the dog because my dog didn't tell me to come here
how in the world did this cake make it onto bakery shelves it is terrible
This cake is garbage
I don't see what all of the hype is about
The other day I microwaved french fries two days after ordering them and that tasted better than this carrot cake
Do not buy cake from the ice cream store their cake quality is very poor
boooooooooo
