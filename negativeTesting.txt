My tongue will never be the same after allowing that travesty of a cake to come in contact with it
this cake was dry tasteless and nasty
The eclairs were bad and so was the service
i would rather eat my own liver than one more bite of that cake
One man's carrot cake is another man's carrot trash
on a spongy texture
Who even likes carrots
The other day I microwaved french fries two days after ordering them and that tasted better than this carrot cake
i never want to eat a cake like that again
I felt I was on the verge of diabetes when I took the first bite of that
That is the lousiest excuse for a cake that I have ever seen
Were there the option of going back in time to stop myself from eating the cake I would do it in a heartbeat
whoever baked this cake does not know how to cook a good cake
The one time I decide to have dessert and this is what I get
I wish I had avoided this
this is my last will and testament I leave everything do the dog because my dog didn't tell me to come here
when i put this cake into my mouth i instantly gagged and spit it out
Overrated bad cake and terrible customer service
You know your cake is bad when you eat the cake and it tastes bad
It's a horrible cake
I don't see what all of the hype is about
Cake will kill your dog if it is made of chocolate
that cake was nasty and disgusting
the baker must have a low iq
Cake sucks
When you eat such a bad cake as this it really puts your life in perspective
this cake is just like mom used to make I always hated it
where did this baker learn to cook
