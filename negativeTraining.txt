I feel like eating this piece if cake could kill me
Whatever flavor cake this is it is gross and very bad
when i put this cake into my mouth i instantly gagged and spit it out
Literally no one could ever enjoy the carrot taste in carrot cake
the baker must have a low iq
Cake will lure you in with a good presentation then torture you with choking
Cake will kill your dog if it is made of chocolate

Each time I am forced to go here I die a little inside
on a spongy texture
the lovely person brought in a poorly made cake
I strip this cake of its title of cake it is a shame to all other cake

It's the worst day of my life and I am 80
Overrated bad cake and terrible customer service

Perhaps I was wrong about this dessert being good
The cake shop in the mall has some atrocious cakes
Too much cake being a good thing is a lie too little is still too much

Your strawberry cake sucks worse than your choclate cake

I wouldn't even donate this carrot cake to the food pantry in case it makes someone sick
The piece yesterday was not a good piece
The deserts here are way overpriced there's no way I'm paying that much for a pastry

The one time I decide to have dessert and this is what I get
i think this cake is worse than the last one i ate
The eclairs were bad and so was the service
i can not recommend this cake it was horrible
Tried your cake and it was hard as a brick
Without a doubt I would choose anything over a cake
i just wanted to eat a delicious cake but was saddened by the pure disgust i felt on the first bite

The other day I microwaved french fries two days after ordering them and that tasted better than this carrot cake
Their banana nut bread tasted dry I needed three glasses of milk after I ate it
Carrot cake really sucks I mean honestly who even likes carrots
that cake caused a great deal of sadness after eating it
This carrot cake literally gave me cancer
how could someone make such a monstrosity of a cake
Were there the option of going back in time to stop myself from eating the cake I would do it in a heartbeat
It feels like cake hates me and honestly I hate it just as much
There was absolutely too much sugar in that cake and it made me what to puke

My tongue will never be the same after allowing that travesty of a cake to come in contact with it
The cake was old
I ordered a graduation cake and it looked nothing like the picture on the website
I don't see what all of the hype is about
Their chocolate cake is awful and it tastes very cheap
